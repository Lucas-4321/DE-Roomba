# DE Final Project: Roomba
# Where did this idea come from?
My main inspiration, as you might be able to tell from what I ended up calling this project, was the roomba. I was extremely inspired to make a robot that functioned by roaming around aimlessly while also avoiding any obstacles in its path. Although I didn't really care about its abilities to clean. Instead of navigating by bumping into objects, like a real roomba does, I decided that it was best to use the distance sensors provided in the pi-top kits.
